"Quizzler" is a simple GUI based app that hooks into the Open Trivia Database. 

It uses Tkinter for all its graphical elements. 

It's quite simple to use and for now includes three categories which just all happen to be my favorite subjects--

1. Computer Science
2. Film
3. Video Games

For future updates, additonal UI options that mirror what's available on the Open Trivia API would be great.
